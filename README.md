# My Deep Learning Journey ðŸš€

Welcome to my deep learning practice repository! This is where I document my learning journey, experiments, and small projects in deep learning.

## About the Repository
- **Purpose**: To track my progress and practice implementing deep learning concepts.
- **Contents**: A collection of mini-projects, practice notebooks, and experiments, including tasks like:
  - Implementing neural networks from scratch
  - Building simple models for tasks like image classification and prediction
  - Exploring libraries like TensorFlow and PyTorch
- **Disclaimer**: These are not production-grade projects but rather my learning exercises. Feedback and suggestions are always welcome! ðŸŒŸ

## Projects Included
1. **Basic Neural Networks**: Hand-coded networks to understand foundational concepts.
2. **Image Classification**: Simple models for classifying images (e.g., cats vs. dogs).
3. **Regression Tasks**: Predicting values using small datasets.
4. **Exploring Architectures**: Experimenting with architectures like CNNs, RNNs, etc.
